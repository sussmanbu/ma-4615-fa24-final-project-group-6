    "text": "Data Exploration\nWe discovered that the dataset Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) included all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and select U.S. territories. The BRFSS gathers standardized state-specific data on health risks, chronic conditions, healthcare access, and preventive services related to leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. Key topics surveyed in 2023 included health status, exercise, chronic conditions, tobacco and alcohol use, immunizations, HIV/AIDS, mental health, seatbelt use, driving behaviors, and COVID. Data is self-reported; proxy interviews are not conducted.\nLandline interviews collect data from randomly selected adults in households, while cellular interviews target adults living in private residences or college housing. However, the exclusion of proxy interviews limits data from individuals with disabilities who require guardians to report on their behalf, or people without phones. Additionally, there is no mention of TTY services or accommodations for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, potentially excluding these populations.\nStarting Data Cleaning\nWe started the data cleaning process, choosing variables, and forming research questions that we wanted to focus on. For example, we cleaned some of the variables by changing their numerical content into more descriptive labels using the codebook.\nExample\ndata2_clean &lt;- data2 |&gt; mutate( PRIMINS1 = case_when( PRIMINS1 == 1 ~ “Employer-based Insurance”, PRIMINS1 %in% c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) ~ “Government Insurance”, PRIMINS1 == 2 ~ “Private Insurance”, PRIMINS1 == 88 ~ “No Insurance”, PRIMINS1 %in% c(77, 99) ~ “Uncertain/Refused”, TRUE ~ “Other” ) )|&gt; rename(insurace_status = PRIMINS1)\nWe are looking at variables that describe Social Determinants and Health Equity such as LSATISFY which asks respondents their general satisfaction with life. Additional variables that describe the respondent’s identity such as variables that describe race, gender, age, education level, income, and insurance statutes. Potential research questions we are interested in have to do with the relationship between race and different health outcomes/mental health, and how those variables contribute to the participant’s current health state."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "This comes from the file data.qmd.\nYour first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.\nI recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.\nIf you create a folder named data this will cause problems.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour load_and_clean_data.R file is how you will load and clean your data. Here is a an example of a very simple one.\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/load_and_clean_data.R\",\n  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  \n)\n\n\n&gt; library(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n&gt; loan_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"dataset\", \"loan_refusal.csv\"))\n\n\nRows: 20 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): bank\ndbl (4): min, white, himin, hiwhite\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n&gt; loan_data_clean &lt;- pivot_longer(loan_data, 2:5, names_to = \"group\", \n+     values_to = \"refusal_rate\")\n\n&gt; write_rds(loan_data_clean, file = here::here(\"dataset\", \n+     \"loan_refusal_clean.rds\"))\n\n\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\).\nYou might consider using the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nLoad and clean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or .RData files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

Publish site to https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME/ using gh-pages? (Y/n)\n[[OP]] Wait for the process to finish.\nOnce it is done, you can go to the URL it asked you about to see your site.\n\nNote: This is the process you will use every time you want to update your published site. Make sure to always follow the steps below for rendering, previewing, and committing your changes before doing these publish steps. Anyone can publish in the future.\n\n\nCustomize your site\n\n[[OP]] Open the _quarto.yml file and update the title to include your team name.\n[[OP]] Go to the about.qmd and remove the TF’s and professor’s names.\nadd your own along with a short introduction and a link to your Github user page.\n[[OP]] Render the site.\n[[OP]] Check and make sure you didn’t get any errors.\n[[OP]] Commit your changes and push.\n[[OP]] Repeat the steps under Setting up your site.\n\nOnce one person is done with this, each teammate in the group can, in turn, repeat steps 3-7. Before doing so, make sure to pull the changes from teammates before starting to make new changes. (We’ll talk soon about ways to organize your work and resolve conflicts.)\n\n\nStart your first post\n\nTo start your first post first, run remotes::install_github(\"sussmanbu/quartopost\") in your Console.\n[[OP]] Run quartopost::quartopost() (or click Addins-&gt;Create Quarto Post, or use C-Shift-P, type “Create Quarto” and press enter to run the command).\n\nNow you can start working on your post. You’ll want to render your post to see what it will look like on the site.\n\nEvery time you want to make a new post, you can repeat step 2 above.\nWhen you want to publish your progress, follow steps 4-7 from Customize your site.\n\nFinally, make sure to read through everything on this site which has the directions and rubric for the final project."

    "text": "Data Set 1:\nOriginal Link: https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/sepher/\nAbout Dataset: This Dataset hopes to reveal information about the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations.\nNumber of rows and columns: 1664 columns and 86457 rows\nThe dataset was created by merging multiple publicly available datasets that include socio-economic, climate risk scores, evictions and housing variables, along with census information for the US. Datasets merged include the CDC vulnerability index dataset, FEMA’s national risk index dataset, and Evictions and Home mortgage data. The Home Mortgage Dataset is managed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Evictions dataset is compiled and managed by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. We also would utilize US census tract data in addition to this dataset. We can load the data and it comes cleaned, but we can clean it further to meet our requirements and needs.\nA theme we want to address is how climate change incidents are impacting different demographics, from a racial and economic standpoint. At what frequency are people being displaced, who are the majority of people being displaced? What are their economic, social, and demographic backgrounds? This is especially relevant because we are currently seeing more extreme natural disasters globally and domestically, this would further inform about the communities that are at the brunt of such disasters. Some challenges we might encounter are challenges that often come with manipulating large datasets. When working with a huge mass of data that has numerous variables it can be difficult to come up with an extremely specific research question, also multiple variables can impact the other and correlate with each other although we might only be assessing a few. Being that the data is so detailed we have to be careful in our analysis when describing variables as correlated or not.\nData Set 2\nOriginal Link: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html\nThis data set ranges over 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands in 2023. It includes self-reported health behaviors (including mental health), chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services survey for 433,323 observations. There are 350 variables detailing characteristics such as race, geography, education levels, marital status, and gender. The data was collected through phone interviews to track trends in behaviors, diseases, and conditions that pose significant risks to health over time and identify different health outcomes across populations.\nBy analyzing this data set, we hope to answer questions like how prevalent certain health risk behaviors are across populations, health disparities, and some variables (such as dietary habits or preventative services) that have a significant impact on the health outcomes. We can also look at mental health and find out groups that are most susceptible to mental health disorders. The data set has a clear codebook to it, but we can do some additional cleaning to make it meet our needs. Some challenges we foresee are that because this is a big data set with 350 variables, we may need to clearly select variables that correlate with our questions.\nData Set 3\nOriginal Link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce06FnS7lX0ilbEjnTmdj71t_UwnbR7fK4BkGO4k25I/edit?usp=sharing\nThis data set is extracted from NLSY79 Cohort, which is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-64. The cohort originally included 12,686 respondents ages 14-22 when first interviewed in 1979; after two subsamples were dropped, 9,964 respondents remain in the eligible samples. We only extracted data from the year 2020 and focused on healthcare information, such as coverage, health conditions, and income. There are 29 columns and 12,686 rows. The immediate challenge we can forsee is that this dataset has many missing data that need to be cleaned, and every variable is labeled by number, which needs further coding to make it more readable. Although it seems challenging to do, I will be able to clean the data. Also, we need to brainstorm what possible information/correlation are interesting and could be pulled out. The potential question: what is the portion with health issues that are covered by a medicare\nIt includes variables: ASSESSMENT OF R’S GENERAL HEALTH\nHOW MUCH SLEEP R GETS AT NIGHT ON WEEKDAYS-HOURS\nSAMPLE IDENTIFICATION CODE\nR’S RACIAL/ETHNIC COHORT FROM SCREENER\nSEX OF R\nIN THE PAST MONTH, DID R SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN FROM AN ILLNESS OR MEDICAL CONDITION?\nIN THE PAST MONTH, HOW OFTEN DID R SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN FROM AN ILLNESS OR MEDICAL CONDITION?\nANYONE IN R’S HOUSEHOLD BESIDES R DISABLED OR CHRONICALLY ILL?\nR HAVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO SEE WHEN SICK OR NEED HEALTH ADVICE?\nR COVERED BY ANY HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION\nSOURCE OF HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION(RESPONDENT) - PRIVATE INSURANCE\nR’S CURRENT/PREVIOUS EMPLOYER\nR COVERED BY MEDICAID\nHOW LONG SINCE R LAST HAD HEALTH CARE COVERAGE\nREASONS R NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE - PERSON WITH INSURANCE LOST JOB OR CHANGED EMPLOYERS\nREASONS R NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE(7 variables about reasons)\nSPOUSE COVERED BY ANY HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION PLAN\nTOTAL INCOME FROM WAGES AND SALARY IN PAST CALENDAR YEAR\nR MISSED PAYMENT OR BEEN AT LEAST 2 MONTHS LATE SINCE DATE OF LAST INTERVIEW?\nFAMILY POVERTY STATUS IN PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR"
