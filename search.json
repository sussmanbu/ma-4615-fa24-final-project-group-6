    "text": "After our initial exploratory analysis, we identified plots that had strong correlations and had interesting observations that we could use to build our story and incorporate well together. We wanted to get a deeper interpretation for some plots and ended up tweaking models, and variables in order to be more concise. We also paired each of our plots with a linear model to provide more context and a more in depth understanding of the data that we have. For example, we had an initial plot that measured the correlation between drug exposure and marijuana use frequency, and we decided to view that frequency for alcohol use and pair it with another graph that showed insights on alcohol use to get a more comprehensive and detailed model. From discussing our observations we are interested in looking at plots that show the relationship between education and loneliness, health status and medical cost affordability, drug exposure to drug use, alcohol use/exposure on physical health, and personal income to a state’s diversity.\nWe also looked at the relationship between one’s health status and its predicted probability of not being able to afford medical costs. The plot shows that there is a steep downward trend in people’s unaffordability of medical costs as their health status increases. This relationship makes sense that people who are in poor health status are less likely to afford medical costs.\nWe also do the plot about the relationship between the alcohol assumption/smoke assumption and BMI category. Unfortunately, both of them have too weak a correlation to show their relationship. The statement we can do now is that: There is no relationship between the alcohol assumption/smoke assumption and BMI category. When we plan to polish your visualizations and tables, we use the bar chart graph in this part, because the BMI has four categories: Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese. The X-axis should be four BMI categories, and the Y-axis is the average alcohol drinks per day.\nAnother plot we chose explores the relationship between the diversity of races of the state and how that relates to the average personal income of the state. This plot had a strong correlation and showed the non-surprising relationship that more diverse states have higher average personal income. To finalize this graph, we will polish the themes and colors to ensure ease of understanding for an unfamiliar reader. Furthermore, we will try to contextualize our findings and link the story together.\nAdditionally in our exploratory analysis for some plots, we didn’t worry the most about header names but for the plots we chose, we wanted to really specify what the plots were visualizing, renaming variables used in the data to actual text ( MARJI1 frequency to Marijuana Use Frequency)."

    "text": "We successfully combined our two datasets on the “state” variable that was present in both datasets, this resulted in a dataset that provided a more comprehensive financial perspective on the factors we are currently looking at. Some of the data analytic questions we explored in the new dataset include: Whether state income is correlated with physical health status, the relationship between state gdp on overall loneliness level, the relationship between alcohol use and state employment quantity, the relationship between Insurance Status, per capita current dollar statistics for each state, and if there is a correlation BMI category and alcohol consumption.\nStatistical models we implemented in our analysis include logistic modeling, which was used to examine the state gdp levels affect the overall tendency to feel lonely. The results were statistically significant, showing that richer states actually correlates with a higher tendency of loneliness. With a 10-fold increase in state GDP, the likelihood of the residents of that state feeling lonely increases by about 8.1%. We also included the factor variable called Age Group, and the model shows that higher age individuals are less likely to experience loneliness when compared to the 18-24 individuals.\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/load_and_clean_data.R\",\n  echo = FALSE \n)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nloneliness &lt;- merged_data|&gt;\n  filter(loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Always\" | loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Usually\" |\n           loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Rarely\" | loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Never\")|&gt;\n  mutate(Binary_lonely = if_else(loneliness_feeling_frequency %in% c(\"Always\", \"Usually\"), 1, 0))|&gt;\n  select(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`, AGE_GROUP, Binary_lonely, EDUCA, `Personal income`)\n\nmod1 &lt;- glm(\n  Binary_lonely ~  log10(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`)+ as.factor(AGE_GROUP),\n  data = loneliness,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n  \nsummary(mod1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Binary_lonely ~ log10(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`) + \n    as.factor(AGE_GROUP), family = \"binomial\", data = loneliness)\n\nCoefficients:\n                                      Estimate Std.

The result is very close to 0, which shows that there is little to no linear relationship between these two variables.\nWe also used box plots to plot the relationship between insurance status and per capita dollar statistics per state. In determining the relationship between BMI category and average alcohol drink per day, we use the box plot with the binomial regression model, but the outcome shows a really weak positive relationship between them. We also explored the relationship between the number of alcoholic drinks and the number of employment across different states using a scatter plot with a fitted line to show the relationship. However, there is a very weak positive correlation between the number of alcoholic drinks and the number of state employment quantities.\nWe want to continue this exploratory analysis in the future with an interest to see how those economic or insurance factors are correlated with socially related or behavioral variables across different races to see the race disparities."

For instance, do factors like life habits, race, and insurance status contribute to poorer health outcomes? Since there is so much to focus on it will take time to come up with more detailed questions, but this is our general direction.\nFor this survey, proxies were unavailable, and it was only accessible to those that had phones, and this excludes specific groups of people (disabled, hearing disorders, mental disabilities, any disability that requires alternate forms of communication) from the data, especially since this is healthcare data, it’s important to be as inclusive as possible. This data could be misused if we are cherry-picking data. It is important to incorporate sub-questions from the data sections so there is an accurate breadth for the questions we are asking. Depending on what variables you include it is possible to skew the information or represent it inaccurately."

    "text": "Data Set 1:\nOriginal Link: https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/sepher/\nAbout Dataset: This Dataset hopes to reveal information about the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations.\nNumber of rows and columns: 1664 columns and 86457 rows\nThe dataset was created by merging multiple publicly available datasets that include socio-economic, climate risk scores, evictions and housing variables, along with census information for the US. Datasets merged include the CDC vulnerability index dataset, FEMA’s national risk index dataset, and Evictions and Home mortgage data. The Home Mortgage Dataset is managed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Evictions dataset is compiled and managed by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. We also would utilize US census tract data in addition to this dataset. We can load the data and it comes cleaned, but we can clean it further to meet our requirements and needs.\nA theme we want to address is how climate change incidents are impacting different demographics, from a racial and economic standpoint. At what frequency are people being displaced, who are the majority of people being displaced? What are their economic, social, and demographic backgrounds? This is especially relevant because we are currently seeing more extreme natural disasters globally and domestically, this would further inform about the communities that are at the brunt of such disasters. Some challenges we might encounter are challenges that often come with manipulating large datasets. When working with a huge mass of data that has numerous variables it can be difficult to come up with an extremely specific research question, also multiple variables can impact the other and correlate with each other although we might only be assessing a few. Being that the data is so detailed we have to be careful in our analysis when describing variables as correlated or not.\nData Set 2\nOriginal Link: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html\nThis data set ranges over 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands in 2023. It includes self-reported health behaviors (including mental health), chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services survey for 433,323 observations. There are 350 variables detailing characteristics such as race, geography, education levels, marital status, and gender. The data was collected through phone interviews to track trends in behaviors, diseases, and conditions that pose significant risks to health over time and identify different health outcomes across populations.\nBy analyzing this data set, we hope to answer questions like how prevalent certain health risk behaviors are across populations, health disparities, and some variables (such as dietary habits or preventative services) that have a significant impact on the health outcomes. We can also look at mental health and find out groups that are most susceptible to mental health disorders. The data set has a clear codebook to it, but we can do some additional cleaning to make it meet our needs. Some challenges we foresee are that because this is a big data set with 350 variables, we may need to clearly select variables that correlate with our questions.\nData Set 3\nOriginal Link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce06FnS7lX0ilbEjnTmdj71t_UwnbR7fK4BkGO4k25I/edit?usp=sharing\nThis data set is extracted from NLSY79 Cohort, which is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-64. The cohort originally included 12,686 respondents ages 14-22 when first interviewed in 1979; after two subsamples were dropped, 9,964 respondents remain in the eligible samples. We only extracted data from the year 2020 and focused on healthcare information, such as coverage, health conditions, and income. There are 29 columns and 12,686 rows. The immediate challenge we can forsee is that this dataset has many missing data that need to be cleaned, and every variable is labeled by number, which needs further coding to make it more readable. Although it seems challenging to do, I will be able to clean the data. Also, we need to brainstorm what possible information/correlation are interesting and could be pulled out. The potential question: what is the portion with health issues that are covered by a medicare\nIt includes variables: ASSESSMENT OF R’S GENERAL HEALTH\nHOW MUCH SLEEP R GETS AT NIGHT ON WEEKDAYS-HOURS\nSAMPLE IDENTIFICATION CODE\nR’S RACIAL/ETHNIC COHORT FROM SCREENER\nSEX OF R\nIN THE PAST MONTH, DID R SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN FROM AN ILLNESS OR MEDICAL CONDITION?\nIN THE PAST MONTH, HOW OFTEN DID R SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN FROM AN ILLNESS OR MEDICAL CONDITION?\nANYONE IN R’S HOUSEHOLD BESIDES R DISABLED OR CHRONICALLY ILL?\nR HAVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO SEE WHEN SICK OR NEED HEALTH ADVICE?\nR COVERED BY ANY HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION\nSOURCE OF HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION(RESPONDENT) - PRIVATE INSURANCE\nR’S CURRENT/PREVIOUS EMPLOYER\nR COVERED BY MEDICAID\nHOW LONG SINCE R LAST HAD HEALTH CARE COVERAGE\nREASONS R NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE - PERSON WITH INSURANCE LOST JOB OR CHANGED EMPLOYERS\nREASONS R NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE(7 variables about reasons)\nSPOUSE COVERED BY ANY HEALTH/HOSPITALIZATION PLAN\nTOTAL INCOME FROM WAGES AND SALARY IN PAST CALENDAR YEAR\nR MISSED PAYMENT OR BEEN AT LEAST 2 MONTHS LATE SINCE DATE OF LAST INTERVIEW?\nFAMILY POVERTY STATUS IN PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR"

Economic and Financial: This category of variables includes computed income categories like “ _INCOMG1” , “MSCODE” which describes the metropolitan status, “EMPLOY1” which describes the employment status of the respondent Income: INCOME3\nThe Health Category : includes variables that contain information regarding mental health and variables with information describing the physical well-being of respondents.\nVariables for Physical health include : “PHYSHLTH” which accounts the number of days respondents are physically unwell. “CHECKUP1” details the time since the last routine checkup. “GENHLTH” renamed “Health Status” describes the general health status of an individual. “POORHLTH” describes the number of days in the past 30 days that an individual’s physical health was not good, “BMI5CAT” contains the respondent’s body mass index, renamed “BMI category”. The Life Habits section also provides some background into a respondent’s physical health, we look at variables like “EXEROFT1” that measures exercise frequency, “EXERHMM1” that measures the amount of time spent exercising, and “_PAINDX3” that meansures the Physical Activity Index.\nVariables for Mental Health : “SDLONELY” which indicates how often respondents feel lonely, “SDHSTRE1” which indicates how often respondents feel stressed, “LSATISFY” which quantifies a respondent’s satisfaction with their life, “EMTSUPRT” which describes how often respondents get the social and emotional support they need, and “MENHLTH” which describes the number of days respondents are mentally unwell.\nContributing Factors : Such as Adverse Childhood Experiences & Social Determinants\n\nThe Social Determinants and Health Equity section contains the variable” FOODSTMP” that details if respondents receive food-stamps (SNAP) during the past 12 months. We also look at many variables that detail adverse childhood experiences, such as respondents living with people who expressed mentally unhealthy behaviors and abused substances. There are additional variables that track if respondents experienced emotional or physical abuse in their childhood. We also are interested in looking at variables that describe the current chronic health conditions of respondents(diabetes, COPD, heart disease, stroke), as well as variables that track their substance use patterns. Such as “ALCDAY4” which tracks alcohol consumption and “DIABETE4” which indicates if a respondent has diabetes. This section of variables provides insight into factors that contribute to the respondents current health status."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Data Exploration\nWe discovered that the dataset Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) included all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and select U.S. territories. The BRFSS gathers standardized state-specific data on health risks, chronic conditions, healthcare access, and preventive services related to leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. Key topics surveyed in 2023 included health status, exercise, chronic conditions, tobacco and alcohol use, immunizations, HIV/AIDS, mental health, seatbelt use, driving behaviors, and COVID. Data is self-reported; proxy interviews are not conducted.\nLandline interviews collect data from randomly selected adults in households, while cellular interviews target adults living in private residences or college housing. However, the exclusion of proxy interviews limits data from individuals with disabilities who require guardians to report on their behalf, or people without phones. Additionally, there is no mention of TTY services or accommodations for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, potentially excluding these populations.\nStarting Data Cleaning\nWe started the data cleaning process, choosing variables, and forming research questions that we wanted to focus on. For example, we cleaned some of the variables by changing their numerical content into more descriptive labels using the codebook.\nExample\ndata2_clean &lt;- data2 |&gt; mutate( PRIMINS1 = case_when( PRIMINS1 == 1 ~ “Employer-based Insurance”, PRIMINS1 %in% c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) ~ “Government Insurance”, PRIMINS1 == 2 ~ “Private Insurance”, PRIMINS1 == 88 ~ “No Insurance”, PRIMINS1 %in% c(77, 99) ~ “Uncertain/Refused”, TRUE ~ “Other” ) )|&gt; rename(insurace_status = PRIMINS1)\nWe are looking at variables that describe Social Determinants and Health Equity such as LSATISFY which asks respondents their general satisfaction with life. Additional variables that describe the respondent’s identity such as variables that describe race, gender, age, education level, income, and insurance statutes. Potential research questions we are interested in have to do with the relationship between race and different health outcomes/mental health, and how those variables contribute to the participant’s current health state."

This dataset is available on Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce.\nWe intend to join the dataset at the state level to look at trends across states for economic factors. Although we haven’t joined our datasets, we have multiple exploratory questions that connect both datasets and have identified possible trends we can look for.\nThe dataset addresses income statuses and disparities across states, we’d like to compare the health statuses across states. Do states with higher income have better income, how is it affecting the quality of life mentally and physically? Are unhealthy behaviors related to income statuses, are high employment related to decreases in substance use? Do areas with higher minority populations vary in wealth? We can look at the price index, does it correlate with having health insurance?\nAfter joining the dataset we will start to investigate our exploratory questions and hopefully create visualizations to better understand the relationships."
