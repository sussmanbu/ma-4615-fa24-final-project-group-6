    "text": "After our initial exploratory analysis, we identified plots that had strong correlations and had interesting observations that we could use to build our story and incorporate well together. We wanted to get a deeper interpretation for some plots and ended up tweaking models, and variables in order to be more concise. We also paired each of our plots with a linear model to provide more context and a more in depth understanding of the data that we have. For example, we had an initial plot that measured the correlation between drug exposure and marijuana use frequency, and we decided to view that frequency for alcohol use and pair it with another graph that showed insights on alcohol use to get a more comprehensive and detailed model. From discussing our observations we are interested in looking at plots that show the relationship between education and loneliness, health status and medical cost affordability, drug exposure to drug use, alcohol use/exposure on physical health, and personal income to a state’s diversity.\nWe also looked at the relationship between one’s health status and its predicted probability of not being able to afford medical costs. The plot shows that there is a steep downward trend in people’s unaffordability of medical costs as their health status increases. This relationship makes sense that people who are in poor health status are less likely to afford medical costs.\nWe also do the plot about the relationship between the alcohol assumption/smoke assumption and BMI category. Unfortunately, both of them have too weak a correlation to show their relationship. The statement we can do now is that: There is no relationship between the alcohol assumption/smoke assumption and BMI category. When we plan to polish your visualizations and tables, we use the bar chart graph in this part, because the BMI has four categories: Underweight, Normal Weight, Overweight, Obese. The X-axis should be four BMI categories, and the Y-axis is the average alcohol drinks per day.\nAnother plot we chose explores the relationship between the diversity of races of the state and how that relates to the average personal income of the state. This plot had a strong correlation and showed the non-surprising relationship that more diverse states have higher average personal income. To finalize this graph, we will polish the themes and colors to ensure ease of understanding for an unfamiliar reader. Furthermore, we will try to contextualize our findings and link the story together.\nAdditionally in our exploratory analysis for some plots, we didn’t worry the most about header names but for the plots we chose, we wanted to really specify what the plots were visualizing, renaming variables used in the data to actual text ( MARJI1 frequency to Marijuana Use Frequency)."

    "text": "We successfully combined our two datasets on the “state” variable that was present in both datasets, this resulted in a dataset that provided a more comprehensive financial perspective on the factors we are currently looking at. Some of the data analytic questions we explored in the new dataset include: Whether state income is correlated with physical health status, the relationship between state gdp on overall loneliness level, the relationship between alcohol use and state employment quantity, the relationship between Insurance Status, per capita current dollar statistics for each state, and if there is a correlation BMI category and alcohol consumption.\nStatistical models we implemented in our analysis include logistic modeling, which was used to examine the state gdp levels affect the overall tendency to feel lonely. The results were statistically significant, showing that richer states actually correlates with a higher tendency of loneliness. With a 10-fold increase in state GDP, the likelihood of the residents of that state feeling lonely increases by about 8.1%. We also included the factor variable called Age Group, and the model shows that higher age individuals are less likely to experience loneliness when compared to the 18-24 individuals.\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/load_and_clean_data.R\",\n  echo = FALSE \n)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nloneliness &lt;- merged_data|&gt;\n  filter(loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Always\" | loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Usually\" |\n           loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Rarely\" | loneliness_feeling_frequency == \"Never\")|&gt;\n  mutate(Binary_lonely = if_else(loneliness_feeling_frequency %in% c(\"Always\", \"Usually\"), 1, 0))|&gt;\n  select(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`, AGE_GROUP, Binary_lonely, EDUCA, `Personal income`)\n\nmod1 &lt;- glm(\n  Binary_lonely ~  log10(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`)+ as.factor(AGE_GROUP),\n  data = loneliness,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n  \nsummary(mod1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Binary_lonely ~ log10(`Gross domestic product (GDP)`) + \n    as.factor(AGE_GROUP), family = \"binomial\", data = loneliness)\n\nCoefficients:\n                                      Estimate Std.

In determining the relationship between BMI category and average alcohol drink per day, we use the box plot with the binomial regression model, but the outcome shows a really weak positive relationship between them. We also explored the relationship between the number of alcoholic drinks and the number of employment across different states using a scatter plot with a fitted line to show the relationship. However, there is a very weak positive correlation between the number of alcoholic drinks and the number of state employment quantities.\nWe want to continue this exploratory analysis in the future with an interest to see how those economic or insurance factors are correlated with socially related or behavioral variables across different races to see the race disparities."

Since there is so much to focus on it will take time to come up with more detailed questions, but this is our general direction.\nFor this survey, proxies were unavailable, and it was only accessible to those that had phones, and this excludes specific groups of people (disabled, hearing disorders, mental disabilities, any disability that requires alternate forms of communication) from the data, especially since this is healthcare data, it’s important to be as inclusive as possible. This data could be misused if we are cherry-picking data. It is important to incorporate sub-questions from the data sections so there is an accurate breadth for the questions we are asking. Depending on what variables you include it is possible to skew the information or represent it inaccurately."

    "text": "Data Set 1:\nOriginal Link: https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/sepher/\nAbout Dataset: This Dataset hopes to reveal information about the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations.\nNumber of rows and columns: 1664 columns and 86457 rows\nThe dataset was created by merging multiple publicly available datasets that include socio-economic, climate risk scores, evictions and housing variables, along with census information for the US. Datasets merged include the CDC vulnerability index dataset, FEMA’s national risk index dataset, and Evictions and Home mortgage data. The Home Mortgage Dataset is managed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Evictions dataset is compiled and managed by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. We also would utilize US census tract data in addition to this dataset. We can load the data and it comes cleaned, but we can clean it further to meet our requirements and needs.\nA theme we want to address is how climate change incidents are impacting different demographics, from a racial and economic standpoint. At what frequency are people being displaced, who are the majority of people being displaced? What are their economic, social, and demographic backgrounds? This is especially relevant because we are currently seeing more extreme natural disasters globally and domestically, this would further inform about the communities that are at the brunt of such disasters. Some challenges we might encounter are challenges that often come with manipulating large datasets. When working with a huge mass of data that has numerous variables it can be difficult to come up with an extremely specific research question, also multiple variables can impact the other and correlate with each other although we might only be assessing a few. Being that the data is so detailed we have to be careful in our analysis when describing variables as correlated or not.\nData Set 2\nOriginal Link: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html\nThis data set ranges over 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands in 2023. It includes self-reported health behaviors (including mental health), chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services survey for 433,323 observations. There are 350 variables detailing characteristics such as race, geography, education levels, marital status, and gender. The data was collected through phone interviews to track trends in behaviors, diseases, and conditions that pose significant risks to health over time and identify different health outcomes across populations.\nBy analyzing this data set, we hope to answer questions like how prevalent certain health risk behaviors are across populations, health disparities, and some variables (such as dietary habits or preventative services) that have a significant impact on the health outcomes. We can also look at mental health and find out groups that are most susceptible to mental health disorders. The data set has a clear codebook to it, but we can do some additional cleaning to make it meet our needs. Some challenges we foresee are that because this is a big data set with 350 variables, we may need to clearly select variables that correlate with our questions.\nData Set 3\nOriginal Link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce06FnS7lX0ilbEjnTmdj71t_UwnbR7fK4BkGO4k25I/edit?usp=sharing\nThis data set is extracted from NLSY79 Cohort, which is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-64. The cohort originally included 12,686 respondents ages 14-22 when first interviewed in 1979; after two subsamples were dropped, 9,964 respondents remain in the eligible samples. We only extracted data from the year 2020 and focused on healthcare information, such as coverage, health conditions, and income. There are 29 columns and 12,686 rows. The immediate challenge we can forsee is that this dataset has many missing data that need to be cleaned, and every variable is labeled by number, which needs further coding to make it more readable. Although it seems challenging to do, I will be able to clean the data. Also, we need to brainstorm what possible information/correlation are interesting and could be pulled out.

    "text": "First Data Set\nThe 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset gathers standardized and state-specific data on health risks and behaviors, chronic conditions, healthcare access, mental health, and other factors related to leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. The data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnership with state health departments and U.S. territories. Key topics surveyed in 2023 included health status, exercise, chronic conditions, tobacco and alcohol use, immunizations, HIV/AIDS, mental health, seatbelt use, driving behaviors, and COVID. Data is self-reported; proxy interviews are not conducted. Landline interviews are conducted with randomly selected adults in households, while cellular interviews focus on adults living in private residences or college housing.\nThere are 350 total variables in the dataset and it contains 433,323 observations. The dataset is available at here.\nWe intended to explore the variables from each categorization:\nThe Identity-Based Category: For variables that describe the identity of respondents\n\n_STATE: Renamed to State.

Avg alcoholic drinks per day in past 30\n\n\nCleaning:\nRegardless of the types of variables, the dataset reports everything using numerical values. For example, “99” may represent the respondent refusing to answer. Therefore, we renamed and recoded many of the variables to make our data clearer in cleaning script. In addition, we also combined variables that are describing the same thing. For example, we combined the number of times respondents did exercise 1(that they spent the most time doing) and exercise 2 (that they spent the second most time doing) per month.\n\nsource(\n  \"scripts/load_and_clean_data.R\",\n  echo = FALSE \n)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nbrfss_clean|&gt;\n  select(RACE, State,Health_status, Exercise_frequency, insurance_status)|&gt;\n  head(5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  RACE  State   Health_status Exercise_frequency insurance_status    \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 White Alabama Fair                        39.0 Government Insurance\n2 White Alabama Very Good                   43.3 Government Insurance\n3 White Alabama Very Good                   34.6 Government Insurance\n4 White Alabama Good                        34.6 No Insurance        \n5 White Alabama Good                        17.0 Government Insurance\n\n\nWe have filtered the missing values in our major variables to ensure the first regression model we are going to do will not be influenced by those.

We have cleaned and transformed the dataset to make it more readable and suitable for analysis. By converting numeric codes into human-readable labels (e.g., health status, race, emotional support) and filtering out incomplete records, the code prepares a dataset that is easier to interpret and analyze, facilitating further analysis and visualization."

    "text": "Motivation Behind Data Analysis\nDriven by the desire to uncover the consistent patterns underlying disparities and inequities in physical and mental health, this analysis aims to explore the critical connections between socioeconomic status, social determinants, and their direct correlation with health outcomes. By analyzing various contributing factors, it seeks to identify the potential causes behind the differing patterns in physical and mental health. By analyzing these factors, this analysis aims to provide evidence-based insights that can inform policy decisions, promote equitable healthcare, and ultimately contribute to a more just society. The proposed thesis is that socioeconomic status and social determinants directly correlate to mental and physical health outcomes, with variations across states and race. The variables of interest are from the following categorizations: \n\nThe Identity-Based Category including State, Education level, and Race.\nThe Economic Category including medical cost, insurance status, income, ability to pay monthly bills.\nThe Health Category including Physical Health, Mental Health, Loneliness, Satisfaction of Life.\nThe Past Exposure Category including variables about answers for did you live with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill, or suicidal? Problem drinker or alcoholic?

    "text": "Data Findings\n\nRacial Disparities in Health (mental and physical status)\n\nRace is a critical factor influencing disparities in mental health outcomes, serving as a lens through which broader socioeconomic inequities and social determinants manifest. The graph illustrates significant racial disparities in mental health outcomes, as measured by the average number of days individuals felt mentally unwell last month. \nThe data suggests that groups with historically limited access to economic resources and healthcare—such as Multiracial individuals, American Indians, and Pacific Islanders—report poorer mental health, with an average close to or higher than 5 days of distress, compared to others. These patterns may possibly be due to the intersection of systemic inequities, such as economic instability, discrimination, and lack of healthcare access, which disproportionately affect certain racial groups. Conversely, groups with comparatively better access to resources and also with the highest average reported income (primarily in the income category $50,000 to &lt; $100,000), such as Asians and Whites, report fewer days of mental health distress, with an average fewer than 3.5 days.\n\nSimilarly, the same trend holds for physical health outcomes as well. As the above bar graph demonstrates, physical health outcomes, as measured in the number of days the respondents felt unwell physically, also display racial disparities. Instead of the multiracial groups, American Indian or Pacific Natives (with an average of 4.4 days) now face the worst physical health outcomes. However, the top 3 racial groups that face the worst physical health outcomes are still those who face the worst mental health distress: Multiracial individuals, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders. On the other hand, Asian, Black, and White individuals all have averages lower than 3 days. They experience better physical health than the other racial groups, which is consistent with their mental health outcomes. This parallel further highlights the disparity across social determinants and socioeconomic status among races, which leads to disparities in health outcomes.\n\n\nEducation and Loneliness Level\nEducation is a significant indicator for socioeconomic status, so it is used to investigate the specific link between socioeconomic status and health outcomes. Across all racial groups, the percentage of survey respondents reporting feelings of loneliness tends to decrease as education level increases. Since loneliness is a key predictor of mental health, a Poisson regression model is used to investigate the relationship between state income and loneliness on the number of days of mental health unwell last month. The predictor state income has undergone log transformations to correct the skewness. The variable loneliness has been filtered to keep only responses “Alway,” “Usually,” “Rarely,” and “Never.” Then, it is transformed into a binary variable. The coefficient for log(state GDP) is 1.861682, which shows that the predicted number of days with poor mental health per month is 543.45% higher for individuals who feel lonely compared to those who do not. Additionally, there are state-level variations: people living in wealthier states have 1.61% more predicted days of poor mental health per month than those in less affluent states with a coefficient of 0.015956. These results are all statistically significant.\nThese findings suggest that socioeconomic factors, such as education level, directly correlate with mental health through their impact on loneliness. This relationship is likely because respondents with higher education levels often report higher incomes and better life satisfaction, which are associated with lower levels of loneliness and, in turn, better mental health outcomes.\n\n\nSocioeconomic Variations across States on Mental Health\n\nThere is a significantly moderate positive correlation (0.31) between the average personal income of a state and the diversity ratio of the state. This means that as a state becomes more diverse, the average personal income of the state increases, suggesting that diversity leads to better economic outcomes for each state. There is also a significantly positive correlation between the average personal income of a state and the average days that mental health is unwell. This means that as a state’s income increases, the average days that mental health is unwell for the population of that state also increases. Though this relationship is significant, it is important to consider that the range for average days that mental health is unwell per state ranges from about 3 to 5 days. \nOverall, this data suggests that the diversity ratio of a state increases average personal income, which then increases the average days that mental health is unwell. Placing this information into a larger cultural context, this is more confirmation that higher diversity leads to higher income, as more diversity often leads to a greater variety of opinions and ideas that can lead to more innovation and therefore more economic growth. It is also understandable that the increase of personal income could cause larger stress in life, possibly related to maintaining the income to sustain the higher-income lifestyle created,  which would lead to more days of decreased mental health. \n\n\nHealth Status and Affordability of Medical Costs\n\nBased on the correlation analysis of medical costs, health status, and insurance status, we observe how socioeconomic factors influence health outcomes. A moderate positive correlation between medical costs and insurance status (0.2607) suggests that having insurance might lead to higher reported medical costs, likely due to better access to healthcare services. The positive correlation between health status and medical costs (0.1413) further indicates that while better health could reduce medical expenses.\nBuilding on this, we developed a logistic regression model to predict the affordability of medical costs based on health status. The model reveals that as health status improves, the predicted probability of affording medical costs increases. The coefficient for health status in the regression model is 0.56291, indicating that a one-unit increase in health status leads to a significant increase in the log-odds of affording medical costs. By converting this coefficient to a percentage change, we find that a better health status corresponds to a 75.58% higher likelihood of being able to afford medical costs.\nThe plot clearly illustrates this trend, with the red line showing the relationship between health status and predicted affordability, while the blue points represent individual predictions. It reveals that individuals with poorer health are less likely to afford medical costs, whereas those in better health are more likely to do so. This supports our thesis that better health status correlates with better access to healthcare resources, emphasizing the impact of social determinants on individuals’ ability to manage medical expenses and their overall well-being.\n\n\nPast Exposure and Current Consumption on Physical Health\n\nRespondents were asked to report the number of days they used marijuana over the past 30 days. The box plot illustrates the distribution of marijuana usage frequencies based on childhood exposure to specific conditions or behaviors. The y-axis represents the number of days marijuana was used in a 30-day period, while the x-axis indicates binary exposure levels: “Yes” for respondents who were exposed to a specific condition or behavior during childhood, and “No” for those who were not.\nMean values are represented by the red dots present in the images. The mean marijuana frequency across all exposure types is larger for respondents who indicated that they were exposed. For example, for alcohol exposure, the mean is 14.59 days for respondents who were not exposed and 16.43 days for respondents who were exposed. Median values show a similar pattern, with higher medians among respondents exposed to a condition or behavior. For example, the median for those not exposed to depression is 10, compared to 20 for those exposed. Participants who were exposed to various adverse childhood experiences are susceptible to higher usage for marijuana.\nAn ANOVA test was performed to assess whether the differences in results between the “Yes” and “No” options were statistically significant. There is a highly significant effect (p &lt; 0.001) of exposure level on marijuana usage, meaning that if an individual is exposed to these conditions in childhood, they are more likely to show differences in marijuana usage frequency. Exposure type alone does not significantly influence marijuana usage, but exposure level is a strong predictor. Additionally, there is no significant interaction between exposure type and exposure level. This suggests that exposure to conditions in childhood has a significant effect on their marijuana usage, regardless of the specific type of exposure. \nThus, we emphasize that exposure to adverse behaviors during childhood has a significant likelihood of shaping current behavioral patterns, particularly concerning health and the impact of exposure to relatively unhealthy conditions. The results underline the importance of addressing and mitigating harmful exposures during childhood to reduce the likelihood of adverse health behaviors later in life.\nCurrent Consumption on Physical Health\nTo examine the relationship between marijuana consumption and physical health, a logistic regression model was employed to assess how marijuana consumption frequency and the inability to pay bills impact physical health status. The variable inability to pay bills was included as a fixed effect as it is shown previously that socioeconomic status can be a significant factor for health status. Physical health status, which was a categorical variable, was transformed into a binary variable, with “1” representing poor health. The regression analysis reveals the coefficient for marijuana to be 0.041412, which indicates that a one-unit increase in marijuana consumption is associated with a 4.23% increase in the likelihood of experiencing poor health. Additionally, financial status plays a significant role: individuals unable to afford monthly bills, such as rent, are 169.16% more likely to report poor health compared to those who can afford their bills, with a coefficient of 0.990144. These findings underscore that, beyond medical costs, other financial stress and one’s personal behaviors are strongly directly correlated with health outcomes, whereas their current behavior is influenced by past exposures. Overall, the results highlight the broader link between socioeconomic status and social determinants with physical health."

    "text": "Is Your Health at Risk? The Unseen Connection Between Money, Race, and Where You Live\nSocioeconomic status and social determinants directly correlate with health outcomes, with variations across race and geography. Socioeconomic factors like education, income, and social determinants—such as current behaviors and past experiences—have a profound impact on both mental and physical health.\n\nPeople’s financial status and access to medical resources may be correlated with their health status. Among factors such as income and accessibility to medical resources, we also observe a positive correlation between the affordability of medical costs and an individual’s health status. As shown in the graph above, individuals with poorer health status are less likely to be able to afford their medical costs. Besides medical costs, other financial stress like inability to afford rent also correlates with poor health.\n\nIn addition, higher education is generally associated with a lower percentage of individuals experiencing loneliness. This is likely due to the fact that individuals with higher education tend to have higher income and better life satisfaction, which in turn lowers loneliness level. These interconnected socioeconomic elements significantly influence overall well-being, life expectancy, and quality of life. \nRecent studies and surveys have revealed a troubling trend across all demographics: people across various age groups and demographics are reporting increased rates of loneliness. In an era defined by digital connectivity, the paradox is clear—people are becoming less socially engaged in meaningful ways, which directly impacts mental health. Loneliness is linked to heightened risks of anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges, underscoring the growing importance of prioritizing mental well-being. The predicted number of days with poor mental health per month is 543.45% higher for individuals who feel lonely compared to those who do not, highlighting the impact of loneliness on our mental well-being. Thus, one’s socioeconomic status such as their education level indirectly associates with mental health outcomes.\nOur social determinants also play a critical role in shaping our behaviors, opportunities, and overall health. The places we live, work, and interact influence access to resources, social interactions, and support systems, all of which are essential for maintaining mental and physical health.\n\nFor instance, it was found that mean marijuana usage frequency is influenced by exposure to adverse childhood experience, such as living with alcoholic, drug-using, or depressed family members. As shown by the comparison of the black horizontal line positions on each graph, individuals who reported prior exposure have higher marijuana consumption today compared to those who did not. Previous exposure to these adversities is linked to higher consumption, which is associated with poorer physical health outcomes.\nThus, we emphasize that exposure to adverse behaviors during childhood has a significant likelihood of shaping current behavioral patterns, particularly concerning health and the impact of exposure to relatively unhealthy conditions. The results underline the importance of addressing and mitigating harmful exposures during childhood to reduce the likelihood of adverse health behaviors later in life.\n\nDespite these factors that influence all demographics, different racial groups experience varied health outcomes. As the graph above illustrates, groups with historically limited access to economic resources and healthcare—such as Multiracial individuals, American Indians, and Pacific Islanders—experience higher levels of mental distress compared to the other racial groups. On the other hand, racial groups with higher income, such as Asian and White, report better mental health status. While the ranking varies slightly for physical health outcomes, a similar pattern emerges. Racial disparities in both physical and mental health outcomes underscore ongoing inequities in healthcare access, social determinants of health, and systemic racism. \n\nThe state you live in can also cause variations in health outcomes. One of the relationships is how increased diversity in a state leads to higher personal income levels, which then leads to more days a month that mental health is unwell. While diversity leads to the positive outcome of increased wealth, increased wealth often comes with added complexity of maintaining that wealth which can lead to decreased mental health. \n\n\nInteractive\nThese plots show how the state you live in can impact key socioeconomic factors. Factors of interest include:\n\nThe average days that mental health is unwell\nThe average days that physical health is unwell\nThe proportion of the state that cannot afford medical costs\nThe proportion of the state that has insurance\n\nChoose the topic you are interested in down below and explore how these factors vary across the U.S. The social factors of interest can negatively impact an individual’s ability to take part in their own lives, including their ability to be successful in social and workplace settings. The economic factors of interest can impact if an individual reaches out for medical care, which can lead to worse health outcomes and decreased quality of life.\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| eval: false\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 640 # Adjust this to fit everything\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(shiny))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidycensus))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf))\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(sf)\noptions(\"readr.edition\" = 1) # keep this to ensure you can download the data\n\n# Define UI for app ----\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n\n  # App title ----\n  titlePanel(\"US Map of Socioeconomic Factors of Interest\"),\n\n  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----\n  verticalLayout(\n    # Input: Select a metric to display\n    selectInput(inputId = \"metric\",\n                label = \"Select a socioeconomic factor to visualize:\",\n                choices = list(\n                  \"Average Days of Unwellness Mental Health\" = \"avg_ment_unwell_days\",\n                  \"Average Days of Unwellness Physical Health\" = \"avg_physical_unwell_days\",\n                  \"Proportion of State That is Unable to Afford Medical Costs\" = \"prop_cannot_afford\",\n                  \"Proportion of State That is Uninsured\" = \"prop_uninsured\"\n                ),\n                selected = \"average_physical_unwell\"),\n\n    # Output: Heatmap ----\n    plotOutput(outputId = \"heatmap\")\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic ----\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  # Load dataset from GitHub pages website\n  map_dataset &lt;- read_rds(\"https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma-4615-fa24-final-project-group-6/scripts/shiny_table.rds\")\n\n\n  # Render the heatmap plot ----\n  output$heatmap &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(map_dataset) +\n      geom_sf(aes_string(fill = input$metric), color = \"white\") +\n      scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n      labs(\n        title = \"US Heatmap by Selected Socioeconomic Factor or Health Status\",\n        fill = \"Value\"\n      ) +\n      theme_minimal() +\n      theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n  })\n}\n\n\n# Create Shiny app ----\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\nEnsuring access to health insurance and promoting socioeconomic equity are not just healthcare issues—they are investments in the long-term well-being of individuals and communities.

We then filtered the answers of “fair” in this variable to make it more indicative. We found that there is a positive correlation between health status and drinks per day, which indicates a potentially reversed causality relationship. People with better health status tend to drink more.\n\ndata2_regre &lt;- data2_clean|&gt;\n  filter(!(Health_status == \"Fair\"))|&gt;\n  mutate(Binary_health = if_else(Health_status %in% c(\"Execellent\", \"Very Good\", \"Good\"), 1, 0))|&gt;\n  filter((CVDINFR4 == 1| CVDINFR4 ==2))|&gt;\n  mutate(heart_attack = if_else(CVDINFR4 == 1, 1, 0))\n  \nlogistic &lt;- glm(data2_regre$Binary_health~ data2_regre$Alcohol_Drinks_Per_Day + \n                 data2_regre$heart_attack)\n\nprint(logistic)\n\n\nCall:  glm(formula = data2_regre$Binary_health ~ data2_regre$Alcohol_Drinks_Per_Day + \n    data2_regre$heart_attack)\n\nCoefficients:\n                       (Intercept)  data2_regre$Alcohol_Drinks_Per_Day  \n                          0.765589                            0.001884  \n          data2_regre$heart_attack  \n                          0.096349  \n\nDegrees of Freedom: 103331 Total (i.e. Null);  103329 Residual\n  (64200 observations deleted due to missingness)\nNull Deviance:      18190 \nResidual Deviance: 18160    AIC: 113600"
